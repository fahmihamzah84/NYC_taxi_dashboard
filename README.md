- Part 1 of my dashboard is a scorecard that showing overall total amount received, average trip distance per year, average net fare amount, and total trip for a year.
- Then you can check the heatmap for any pickup zone in NYC.
- The next one is bar chart that comparing every vendor for average fare amount, trip distance, and tip amount
The line chart here, is total trip for every day in NYC, we can look that there is a peak for total trip for every 7 days.
- Then the last chart is pie chart that showing percentage of payment type used by customers.
